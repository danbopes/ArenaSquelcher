# ArenaSquelcher
A simple addon to disable arena broadcasts on Netherwing. Essentially persists '.character arenaBroadcast'

## Depreciated
This addon is now considered obsolete. In server revision 2910, '.character arenaBroadcast' settings are saved, and are persisted automatically through sessions.
